            Hi, I'm Umer Khan — and I built Vidify Games.

            <p>
              I started Vidify Games because I kept running into the same problem: most of the content out there that tries to teach real-world skills — budgeting, investing, coding basics, world knowledge — is either too dry to sit through, or it gets hidden behind a paywall. I wanted something different. Something you could actually sit down with, spend ten minutes on, and walk away having genuinely learned something.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I built the games myself, from scratch. Every single one — no third-party embeds, no recycled content. Vidify Games now has thirty original browser-based games across four categories: Finance Games, Tech &amp; Logic Games, Educational Games, and Brainstorming Games. Whether you're practicing how to build a budget, learning to read binary, brushing up on world capitals, or just keeping your mind sharp, there's something here for you.
            </p>

            <p>
              The idea behind everything on this site is simple: people learn better when they're actually engaged. A game gives you something to react to, to fail at, to try again. It makes the skill feel real in a way that reading a bulleted list just doesn't. Every game on Vidify Games is built around one practical idea — one thing you can actually use — and each game page includes a short, plain-English article explaining what the skill is and why it matters.
            </p>

            <p>
              I take accuracy seriously. Every article and every game mechanic gets reviewed before it goes live. I'm not trying to fill pages with content for the sake of it — I'd rather have thirty games that genuinely work than three hundred that are just noise. If something isn't accurate or isn't useful, it doesn't belong here.
            </p>

            <p>
              Vidify Games is and always will be completely free. No signup, no download, no paywall. I believe that tools for learning should be open to everyone, and that's not going to change.
            </p>
