        answer: 'The average person types around 40 WPM, trained typists hit 60 to 80, and top performers exceed 100. A practical target for most office work is 60 to 80 WPM, which lets you write as fast as you think without corrections slowing you down.',

      {
        question: 'Should I type as fast as I possibly can?',
        answer: 'No. Typing at about 90% of your top speed significantly reduces errors, and fewer corrections means your effective speed is actually higher than when you max out and make mistakes. The game shows both WPM and accuracy live to help you find that sweet spot.',
